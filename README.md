#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

### Specification
You have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Your job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality. 

## Project Overview: Stage 1 [DONE]
For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

## Project Overview: Stage 2 [DONE]
For the second stage of the project, json data is now being fetched from a local API server. Restaurants and reviews are being stored in IndexedDB for offline use.

## Project Overview: Stage 3
Coming soon...

### Running the API Server
The API server needs to be running locally for this to function. You can find the API server here:
https://github.com/Udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-3

### What do I do from here?
1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
